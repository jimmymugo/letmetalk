## üî¨ **Comprehensive Analysis System Details**

### **How It Works**
The comprehensive analysis system evaluates players using multiple dimensions:

1. **ICT Index Analysis**: 
   - **Influence**: How much the player affects the game
   - **Creativity**: Chance creation and assist potential
   - **Threat**: Goal-scoring threat and attacking potential

2. **Expected Goals/Assists (xG/xA)**:
   - Uses underlying performance metrics
   - More reliable than actual goals/assists for prediction
   - Considers shot quality, pass quality, and positioning

3. **Availability Assessment**:
   - Rotation risk based on minutes played
   - Injury risk assessment
   - Team selection probability

4. **Position-Specific Analysis**:
   - **Goalkeepers**: Saves, clean sheet potential, save points
   - **Defenders**: Attacking threat, clean sheets, bonus potential
   - **Midfielders**: Creativity, goal threat, assist potential
   - **Forwards**: Goal-scoring potential, assist potential, bonus points

5. **Team Strength Integration**:
   - Fixture difficulty analysis
   - Opponent defensive/attacking strength
   - Home/away advantage consideration

### **Why This Matters**
Traditional FPL analysis often focuses on recent form, which can be misleading. The comprehensive system identifies players with:
- High underlying performance metrics (good xG/xA)
- Strong ICT Index scores (consistent influence)
- Good availability (low rotation risk)
- Favorable fixtures
- Position-specific strengths

This leads to better squad selection and improved FPL performance!
